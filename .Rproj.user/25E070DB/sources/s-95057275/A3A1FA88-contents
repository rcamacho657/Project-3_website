Have you ever been curious about how R and python are able to communicate with each other, well me too. Let's try to explain their communication process, we can say that R and python are two different people and these two different are named Anna and Hans. Yes, these are the characters from the movie Frozen and yes this is corny, but there is a reason for this wacky explanation. Hans and Anna meet and are madly in love as they both have experienced love at first site. They want to explain themselves in way where they can both understand how they feel about each other so how do they do this? They do it in the form of singing a song, "Love Is an Open Door", as they explain their feelings for each other to each other. Hans, which represpesnts R, and Anna, which represnts python, don't know how to explain or show their feelings for each other, so they need a way to explain it and they use a song, the reticulate package from R, to show and communicate their love for each other. To do this in R, you would need to have the reticulate package installed in R.


```{R}
library(reticulate)
Hans <- "I mean its crazy, we finish each other's..."
```

```{python}
Anna="SANDWICHES!"
print(r.Hans,Anna)
```

And that my friends is how song, the reticulate package from R, can be the language of love between two people, in this case its R and python, when the words aren't enough. Although this was such a nice song and moment in the movie, it was quite sad and misleading because Hans didn't really love Anna. Hans was truly just power hungry and established a plot to marry Anna, kill Elsa, and become the king of Arrendale, but besides that songs can be a way to tell someone how you truly and deeply feel.
